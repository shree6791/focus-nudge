# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Focus Nudge is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed with privacy as a core principle - we collect minimal data and store everything locally on your device.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

**Minimal Data:**
- **User ID**: A locally-generated anonymous identifier (format: `fn_[extension-id]_[timestamp]`) used only for license verification
- **Usage Metrics**: Stored locally on your device:
  - Number of nudges shown
  - Early exits (when you leave LinkedIn after a nudge)
  - Estimated time reclaimed
  - Weekly summary statistics

### What We Don't Collect

- ❌ No personal information (name, email, etc.)
- ❌ No browsing history
- ❌ No LinkedIn activity data
- ❌ No tracking or analytics
- ❌ No data sent to third-party services (except Stripe for payments)

## Data Storage

### Local Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.local`:
- Settings (tone, drift threshold, cooldown)
- Weekly metrics
- License key (for Pro users)
- User ID

**This data:**
- ✅ Never leaves your device
- ✅ Never syncs to cloud
- ✅ Is deleted if you uninstall the extension
- ✅ Is not accessible to websites

### Backend Storage (Pro Users Only)

If you subscribe to Pro:
- **User ID**: Stored to verify your subscription
- **License Key**: Generated and stored to activate Pro features
- **Stripe Customer ID**: Linked to your subscription (managed by Stripe)

**This data:**
- ✅ Only used for license verification
- ✅ Never shared with third parties
- ✅ Can be deleted by canceling your subscription

## Payment Processing

Pro subscriptions are processed through **Stripe**, a secure payment processor:
- Payment information is handled entirely by Stripe
- We never see or store your credit card details
- Stripe's privacy policy applies to payment data: https://stripe.com/privacy

## Data Usage

### How We Use Your Data

1. **License Verification**: User ID is sent to our backend to verify Pro subscription status
2. **Local Metrics**: Weekly summary is calculated from locally-stored data
3. **Settings**: Your preferences are stored locally and applied to nudges

### Third-Party Services

- **Stripe**: Payment processing (see Stripe's privacy policy)
- **No other third-party services** are used

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share your data with:
- ❌ Advertisers

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- ✅ **Access**: View all data stored locally (via browser DevTools)
- ✅ **Delete**: Uninstall the extension to delete all local data
- ✅ **Control**: Adjust settings anytime in the options page
- ✅ **Cancel**: Cancel Pro subscription anytime via Stripe Customer Portal

## Data Retention

- **Local Data**: Stored until you uninstall the extension
- **Backend Data**: Retained while your subscription is active, deleted when canceled

## Security

- All data transmission uses HTTPS
